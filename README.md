# 🧠AI-Powered Employee Performance Analyzer🔥

## 📌 Overview
The **AI-Powered Employee Performance Analyzer** is a dynamic **web-based AI application** built using **Streamlit**. This tool allows organizations to analyze employee performance, compare it with department averages, and predict future performance using **Machine Learning models** such as:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

The application is fully interactive, enabling users to **upload datasets, select departments and employees**, visualize performance trends, and predict future employee performance.

It enables users to:
- Upload and preview an employee dataset.
- Select and visualize employee performance against department averages.
- Train different ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict employee performance.
- Predict employee safety status based on performance thresholds.

## 🚀 Features
- **CSV File Upload**: Allows users to upload an employee dataset.
- **Dynamic Feature Selection**: Users can select department, employee, and performance metrics.
- **Dynamic Feature Selecton and visualization**: - Employee performance analysis with pie charts by Select the categorical and numerical features for analysis.
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Bar charts to compare individual vs. department performance.
- **Machine Learning Model Selection**: Train and evaluate different models.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Predict an employee’s performance and assess their safety status.
